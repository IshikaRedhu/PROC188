DESIGN THINKING OF 
        3D MAZE APP
        
        
Empathize:
   This will be a maze game to check the critical thinking of user. THe target audience is mainly the age group 8-18. This will prove beneficial in making
   people aware of consequences of their action and henve will make children more responsible and mature.

Defining:
  Challenges I might face are that i will probably not able to find required libraries, any particular block of code or i will miss a small bug.Another problem 
  may be the layout, how should i keep it ? what colours ?  and all that confusion {similar to preplanning}
  
Ideate:
  Physics and navmesh would be included. There will be one level for know but that will be quite difficult and interesting. I will try to add timelimit as well
  to make it even more challenging. There are not much rules because there is no way of cheating except manipulating the code..
  
Prototype:
  3D texts will be there, player will be there, ofc the maze walls be there, a timer will be running on top left of screen, top view will be provided. There will
  only be one screen along with the alert messages about winning and losing {Simple yet Innovative}
  
Testing:
  Will be done after this project is done. Hoping for best. I will update really soon after testing MOdifications might be done along with testing. These steps are 
  not 100% fixed but yet enough for a roadmap like thing...
